# Short linear motif conservation - landing page

This is just a page with links to the different parts of the analysis

## PairK - [PairK](https://github.com/jacksonh1/pairk)
- python library for quatifying conservation of sequence fragments in IDRs
- [documentation](https://pairk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- intended for general use

## Pipeline 1 - [slim_conservation_orthogroup_generation](https://github.com/jacksonh1/slim_conservation_orthogroup_generation) 
- a tool to access a local version of the orthoDB database and generate orthogroups prepared for conservation analysis
- intended for general use

## Pipeline 2 - [slim_conservation_scoring](https://github.com/jacksonh1/slim_conservation_scoring)
- a tool to quantify the conservation of potential slim sequences from a database of multiple sequence alignments.
- intended for general use

## Benchmark - [benchmark](https://github.com/jacksonh1/slim_conservation_benchmark)
- a benchmark testing the performance of PairK on a dataset of known SLiMs
- it is associated with the PairK manuscript
- intended for record keeping purposes but it is documented in readme files and notebooks
