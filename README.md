# Short linear motif conservation - landing page

This is just a page with links to the different parts of the analysis

## Pipeline 1 - [orthogroup generation](https://github.com/jacksonh1/orthogroup_generation) 
- a tool to access a local version of the orthoDB database and generate orthogroups prepared for conservation analysis
- intended for general use

## Pipeline 2 - [quantification of SLiM conservation](https://github.com/jacksonh1/motif_conservation_in_IDRs)
- a tool to quantify the conservation of potential slim sequences from a database of multiple sequence alignments.
- intended for general use

## Benchmark - [benchmark](https://github.com/jacksonh1/slim_conservation_benchmark)
- intended for record keeping purposes but it is documented with notebooks. 
- Pipeline 1 is used here to create the benchmark
